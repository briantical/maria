							<h6>The Background</h6>
							<p>
								With the spread of Covid-19, the government of Uganda had to
								implement strict restrictions as a preventative measure against
								the pandemic. As with most countries, a lockdown was imposed in
								the country for a period of close to 7 months. Tighter
								restrictions were imposed on public places especially bars,
								religious places and markets.
							</p>
							<p>
								In regards to the markets, the vendors were required to remain
								at their places of work and barred from travelling back to their
								homes. Markets were required to practise social distancing for
								both vendors and customers. This was in addition to the Standard
								Operating Procedures laid out by the Ministry of Health.
							</p>
							<p>
								The current world situation affected these vendors differently
								in these markets. We interviewed a total of 6 market vendors in
								Makerere Kikoni Trade Center to get their experiences in the
								world with a pandemic.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h6>Data Collection Methodologies</h6>
							<p>
								Interviews: We interviewed numerous vendors. With emphasis on
								the oral interviews , we engaged with many vendors that shared
								their experiences with us. The main hindrance was language
								barrier as many of the vendors spoke the local languages that
								were different from what we were acquainted with.
							</p>
							<p>
								Video Recording: We used our phone cameras to record the
								responses from interviewees in real time . These were backups
								and refreshers for the interviews in case we had missed a key
								detail during the interview.
							</p>

							<h6>Common experiences among the vendors</h6>
							<p>
								Transport: Restrictions on the use of public transport posed a
								challenge to the majority of the vendors. Most of them lived in
								the suburban areas of the city far away from their working
								areas. There were limited options for transport and despite the
								loosening on the restriction, the transport fares skyrocketed.
								This was still unviable in regards to their income.
							</p>
							<p>
								Trade: There was a drop in the daily customers as the
								university, which provided their largest customer base, had been
								closed in accordance with presidential guidelines. With
								virtually no customers to serve, most of the vendors closed
								shop. There has been some recovery as the university has resumed
								though the numbers are still low.
							</p>
							<p>
								Health: The pandemic and the restrictions imposed have affected
								the health of most of the videos. The transport restrictions
								limited access to health care facilities. The curfew imposed in
								the country limited the time and delivery of emergency services
								to most of the vendors.

							<h6>Demographic correlation to the responses</h6>
							<p>
								Makerere is the hub of the largest academic institution in
								Uganda. Most of the local economy is directly or indirectly
								supported by the students living in the surrounding area. The
								abrupt closure of the University in response to Covid-19 led to
								a steep decline in the sales of most market vendors.Most of them
								didnâ€™t recover once the restrictions were loosened.

						<div>
							Vendors should diversify and innovate for their businesses in
							regard to the changing market environment. They should utilise
							online platforms like social media to increase their visibility
							and target market.
						</div>
						<div>
							<h6>Actions by the College</h6>
							<p>
								The College of Computing and Informatics Science (COCIS) could
								build a platform that will support the market vendors by
								providing them a service to market and sell the goods, promote
								the businesses and enhance their visibility.

						Most of the vendors in Kikoni Trade Center have been negatively
						affected by the pandemic. This has exposed the level of resilience
						of these businesses in the face of a pandemic. There was clear
						evidence for the need of diversification within their businesses.
